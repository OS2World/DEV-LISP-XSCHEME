This is a preliminary port of XScheme 2.0 to OS/2.

Note: I did not do this port, nor do I have the information on the
author who did.  I just tweaked the source a bit so that it would
compile under IBM's C Set/2.  It was originally ported to MS's
cl386.exe.

If you have any questions or suggestions (please, suggestions) send them
to me at rafetmad@oxy.edu.

PS: This is a preliminary version.  Later versions will hopefully compile
under gcc 2.1.
